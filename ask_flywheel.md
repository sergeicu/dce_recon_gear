# API 
- cannot get API keys (see below)
# Manifest 
- need help with defining enums...
- what should 'docker-image' point to - compiled pure docker image or compiled flywheel docker image?



# Issue sent to Flywheel support team: 
Hi - I need to generate API key for my flywheel account (im trying to build a gear). When I click on 'profile' in the top right corner of flywheel user site i am redirected back to the exact same page where i started (i.e. nothing happens). 

Hi Nancy - please see attached screenshots - 1. my home page on flywheel 2. the 'loading screen'. After loading screen I am returned back to 1....
